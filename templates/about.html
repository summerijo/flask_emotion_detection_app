            <p>Face emotion recognition, also known as facial emotion recognition, refers to the automated process of detecting and identifying the emotional states expressed by individuals through their facial expressions. This technology utilizes computer vision algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze facial features such as the arrangement of eyebrows, eyes, nose, and mouth, as well as changes in facial muscle movements, to infer the emotional state of a person. The primary goal of face emotion recognition is to accurately categorize emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust, among others.</p>
